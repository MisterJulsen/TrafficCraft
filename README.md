#### **TrafficCraft is a Minecraft mod that brings roads, traffic signs, traffic lights and much more to your worlds. Build your own cities and roads according to your wishes.**

This mod is inspired by [Mapper's RoadStuff Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/road-stuff "Mapper's RoadStuff Mod on Modrinth"), which unfortunately has been discontinued. However, this mod is not a copy of the official RoadStuff mod, but its own version, which also includes additional content, such as traffic lights, traffic signs, street lamps and more.
