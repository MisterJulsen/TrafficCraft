# TrafficCraft

#### **TrafficCraft is a Minecraft mod that brings roads, traffic signs, traffic lights and much more to your worlds. Build your own cities and roads according to your wishes.**

This mod is inspired by [Mapper's RoadStuff Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/road-stuff "Mapper's RoadStuff Mod on Modrinth"), which unfortunately has been discontinued. However, this mod is not a copy of the official RoadStuff mod, but its own version, which also includes additional content, such as traffic lights, traffic signs, street lamps and more.

## **Please note!**
To protect your world from damage, you should always create a backup of your world before installing an update of this mod. Alpha versions in particular may contain critical bugs!

## **Supported Versions**
A **fabric** version of this mod is currently **not planned** and the mod is mainly ported to **newer versions**. Please don't ask when the update for version X will come out as I don't know myself. The update will come when I have time for it and it's ready.

## **Dependencies**
This mod uses **DragonLib** as a library mod that contains useful code shared accross all my mods. DragonLib is embedded in all builds of TrafficCraft since version `0.6.0-beta-1.18.2`, so you don't need to install DragonLib manually. If you are developer and are interested in this library you can find more information about it on [GitHub](https://github.com/MisterJulsen/MC-DragonLib "DragonLib on GitHub").
