#### **TrafficCraft is a Minecraft mod that brings roads, traffic signs, traffic lights and much more to your worlds. Build your own cities and roads according to your wishes.**

This mod is heavily inspired by [MapperBase's RoadStuff Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/road-stuff "MapperBase's RoadStuff Mod"), which unfortunately has been discontinued. However, this mod is not a fork of the official RoadStuff mod, but its own and completely rewritten version, which also includes some additional content, such as traffic lights, traffic signs, street lamps and more.

#### **Content**
_Below is the content currently included in the mod. This list is not final yet, new content can be added at any time._

 - Road Blocks: Asphalt, Concrete and slopes of the same materials which act like snow layers
 - Traffic Signs: Choose between hunderds of different variants
 - Traffic Light: Build working traffic lights at your street crossings
 - Paint System: Use a paint brush to paint hundreds of different patterns on your streets in all 16 different colors. Use the brush to color other blocks of this mod as well like guardrails.
 - Street Lamps
 - Guardrails
 - Traffic Cones
... and more ...

#### **Supported Languages**
 - English (100%)
 - German (100%)

#### **Please note ...**
... when using this mod (especially **alpha** versions) that it can always contain bugs that could potentially **damage your world**! So please make a **backup** of your world before embedding this mod.

#### **Supported Versions**
A **fabric** version of this mod is currently **not planned** and the mod is mainly ported to **newer versions**. Please don't ask when the update for version X will come out as I don't know myself. The update will come when I have time for it and it's ready.
